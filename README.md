# hey
We're Linear Tools development team!

## Why do you have a Github organization?
At the time of writing we hav 10s of private github repositorys and planned products for Linear that having each one on a different account is very time consuming to handle. An organization is great for this!

## What technologies do you use
We use heroku and aws ec2 to host our projects
For static websites sometimes we'll use Vercel or Netlify
